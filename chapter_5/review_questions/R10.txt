R10. Define and contrast the following terms: subnet, prefix, and BGP route.
--------------

A subnet is a group of hosts that share the same network prefix and can directly communicate without a router. 
A prefix is the notation used to represent a contiguous block of IP addresses, defined by a network address and mask length, such as 192.168.1.0/24. 

A BGP route, in contrast, is an advertisement of reachability to a prefix along with routing attributes like AS-path and next hop. 
Subnet and prefix describe addressing, while a BGP route is a routing announcement that tells the Internet how to reach a prefix.
