R2. What is meant by a control plane that is based on logically centralized control? 

In such cases, are the data plane and the control plane implemented within the same device or in separate devices? Explain.
----------

In a logically centralized control plane, routing decisions are made by a central controller that has a network-wide view. 
The controller computes the forwarding state and installs it into the routers. This makes the routers primarily simple forwarding devices, with the control logic separated out. 

The control and data planes are therefore implemented in separate devices: the control plane in the centralized controller, and the data plane in the individual routers.
