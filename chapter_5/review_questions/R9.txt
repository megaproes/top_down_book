R9. What is meant by an area in an OSPF autonomous system? Why was the concept of an area introduced?
------------------

An OSPF area is a logical grouping of routers within an AS. Each area maintains its own link-state database and runs SPF locally. 

Routers donâ€™t need to know the full topology of other areas, only summary routes to reach them. 

The area concept was introduced to improve scalability: it reduces flooding and SPF computation overhead in large networks. 

The backbone area (Area 0) connects all other areas together.
