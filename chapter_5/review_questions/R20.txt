R20. What two types of ICMP messages are received at the sending host executing the Traceroute program?
--------
When executing traceroute, the sender receives two kinds of ICMP messages. From intermediate routers, it receives ICMP Time Exceeded messages, since the TTL expires along the path. 

From the final destination host, it receives ICMP Destination Unreachable (Port Unreachable), since traceroute sends UDP probes to an unused port. 

These two types of ICMP responses allow traceroute to identify the routers along the path and the final destination.
