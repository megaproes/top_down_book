R8. True or false: When an OSPF route sends its link state information, it is sent only to those nodes directly attached neighbors. Explain.
-----------------

False. An OSPF router sends link-state advertisements to its directly attached neighbors, but those neighbors flood the information further. 

This controlled flooding continues until all routers in the OSPF area receive the link-state information. 

That’s how OSPF ensures every router has a complete and consistent view of the area’s topology. 

This ensures every router in the area builds the same link-state database and can run Dijkstra’s SPF algorithm.
