R3. Compare and contrast the properties of a centralized and a distributed routing algorithm. 
Give an example of a routing protocol that takes a centralized and a decentralized approach.
-----------------

A centralized routing algorithm runs on a central controller with a complete global view of the network. It computes the best paths for all routers and pushes forwarding information out to them. 
This allows globally optimal routing decisions, but it raises scalability and reliability concerns. 

A distributed routing algorithm, on the other hand, is run by each router independently, with routers exchanging information with neighbors to gradually converge to correct routes. 
This is more scalable and fault-tolerant, but convergence may be slower and less consistent. 

An example of a centralized approach is routing in an SDN controller, while examples of distributed approaches include RIP (distance vector) and OSPF (link state)
