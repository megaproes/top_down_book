R1. What is meant by a control plane that is based on per-router control? 

In such cases, when we say the network control and data planes are implemented “monolithically,” what do we mean?
--------------

A control plane based on per-router control means that each router runs its own routing algorithms (e.g., OSPF, BGP, RIP), computes routes independently, 
and installs the resulting forwarding entries into its local FIB. The data plane then forwards packets using that FIB. 

When we say the network control and data planes are implemented ‘monolithically,’ we mean that both planes are bundled 
inside each router -- each router contains the full control logic and forwarding functions, rather than being separated or centralized as in SDN.
