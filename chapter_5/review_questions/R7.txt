R7. Why are different inter-AS and intra-AS protocols used in the Internet?
--------------

Different routing protocols are used because the goals are different. Intra-AS protocols like OSPF or IS-IS are designed for efficiency and fast convergence within 
a single administrative domain, where routers can fully cooperate. 

Inter-AS routing with BGP, however, must scale to the global Internet and respect business and policy constraints between independent organizations. 
BGP prioritizes policy and scalability over fast convergence, which is why the Internet separates intra-AS and inter-AS routing.
