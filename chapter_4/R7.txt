R7. Discuss why each input port in a high-speed router stores a shadow copy of the forwarding table.
------

Each input port keeps a shadow copy of the forwarding table so it can perform lookups locally and forward packets at line speed. 

This avoids the delay and bottleneck that would occur if every packet had to consult a centralized processor.
