R24. Suppose there are three routers between a source host and a destination host.

1. Ignoring fragmentation, an IP datagram sent from the source host to the destination host will travel over how many interfaces? 

2. How many forwarding tables will be indexed to move the datagram from the source to the destination?
------------

1. It will travel first the host's interface (+1), then the next R1 ingress NIC interface then its egress (+2); 
then ingress of R2 and egress of R2 (+2); 
then ingress of R3 and egress of R3 (+2); 
and then finally ingress of final host (+1).

So final travelled interfaces is 8.

2. Forwarding tables are stored inside router, so only 3.
