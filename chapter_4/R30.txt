R30. Compare and contrast the IPv4 and the IPv6 header fields. 

Do they have any fields in common?
-----------------

These are two different protocols used to uniquely indentify a host in Internet. 

IPv6 simplified the header compared to IPv4: it dropped fields like checksum, fragmentation, and header length to speed up forwarding. 
IPv6 also introduced new fields like Flow Label and extension headers for flexibility. 
The common fields between IPv4 and IPv6 are version, traffic class/type of service, hop limit/TTL, next-header/protocol, and source/destination addresses
