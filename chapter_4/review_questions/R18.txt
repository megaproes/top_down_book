R18. What field in the IP header can be used to ensure that a packet is forwarded through no more than N routers
------------

TTL field.

The Time to Live (TTL) field in the IP header is used to ensure a packet is forwarded through no more than a specified number of routers. 

Each time a packet passes through a router, its TTL value is decreased by one. 

If the TTL reaches zero before reaching the destination, the packet is discarded.
