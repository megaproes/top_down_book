R2. We noted that network layer functionality can be broadly divided into data plane functionality and control plane functionality. 

What are the main functions of the data plane? Of the control plane?
--------------

The data plane performs packet forwarding using forwarding tables located at the input ports (often implemented in hardware such as ASICs).

The control plane runs in software on the CPU, computing and distributing the routing tables that populate those forwarding tables.
