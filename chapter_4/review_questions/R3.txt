R3. We made a distinction between the forwarding function and the routing function performed in the network layer.

Routing is the control-plane function of computing best paths to destinations and installing them into the forwarding tables.

Forwarding is the data-plane function of directing incoming packets from input ports to the appropriate output ports based on those tables.
