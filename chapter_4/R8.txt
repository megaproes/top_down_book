R8. What is meant by destination-based forwarding? 
How does this differ from generalized forwarding (assuming youâ€™ve read Section 4.4, which of the two approaches are adopted by Software-Defined Networking)?
--------------------

Destination-based forwarding uses only the destination IP address to decide the output port.

Generalized forwarding can use multiple header fields (e.g., source/destination addresses, port numbers, protocol type, etc.) 
to make forwarding decisions.

SDN adopts generalized forwarding, enabling flexible and programmable control of packet flows.
