R6. In Section 4.2, we saw that a router typically consists of input ports, output ports, a switching fabric and a routing processor. 

1. Which of these are implemented in hardware and which are implemented in software? Why? 

2. Returning to the notion of the network layerâ€™s data plane and control plane, which are implemented in hardware and which are implemented in software? Why?
-------------------

1. The input/output ports and switching fabric are implemented in hardware to enable very fast lookups and packet switching. 
The routing processor is implemented in software since it handles complex computations such as route calculations and network services.

2. The data plane (input/output ports and switching fabric) is implemented in hardware for high-speed forwarding, 
while the control plane is implemented in software to compute and distribute routing information.
