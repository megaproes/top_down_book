P14. Consider a subnet with prefix 128.119.40.128/26. 
1. Give an example of one IP address (of form xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx) that can be assigned to this network.
----------
Suppose an ISP owns the block of addresses of the form 128.119.40.64/26.
Suppose it wants to create four subnets from this block, with each block having the same number of IP addresses. 

2. What are the prefixes (of form a.b.c.d/x) for the four subnets?
----------

1. Any IP from range (128.119.40.128 -- 128.119.40.191) is fine, for example 128.119.40.160

2. ISP owns the range of 128.119.40.64 to 128.119.40.127, or 64 addresses total. 
It divides 64/4 = 16, so 16 addrs. per subnet, which are:
Subnet 1: 128.119.40.64 - 128.119.40.79 - 128.119.40.64/28
Subnet 2: 128.119.40.80 - 128.119.40.95 - 128.119.40.80/28
Subnet 3: 128.119.40.96 - 128.119.40.111 - 128.119.40.96/28
Subnet 4: 128.119.40.112 - 128.119.40.127 - 128.119.40.112/28
