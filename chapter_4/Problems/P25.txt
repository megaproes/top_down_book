P25. Consider the Internet protocol stack in Figures 1.23 and 4.31. 

Would you consider the ICMP protocol to be a network-layer protocol or a transport-layer protocol? Justify your answer.
-----------------
ICMP is a network-layer protocol. It doesn’t use port numbers like transport-layer protocols do. 

Instead, it’s tightly integrated with IP and is used for error reporting and control messages (for example, Destination Unreachable, Time Exceeded, Echo Request/Reply). 

ICMP supports the operation of IP itself, so it’s considered part of the network layer rather than the transport layer.
