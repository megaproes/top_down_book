P1. Consider the network below.
a. Show the forwarding table in router A, such that all traffic destined to host H3 is forwarded through interface 3.
b. Can you write down a forwarding table in router A, such that all traffic
from H1 destined to host H3 is forwarded through interface 3, while all traffic from H2 destined to host H3 is forwarded through interface 4?
(Hint: This is a trick question.)
---------------------

a.
Destination Network		 Next Hop		Output Interface
H3 IP				 B.1				A.3			

b. No, because forwading table is destination-based, not source based. So it's not possible.
