P18. Consider the network setup in Figure 4.25. Suppose that the ISP instead
assigns the router the address 24.34.112.235 and that the network address of the home network 
is 192.168.1/24.

a. Assign addresses to all interfaces in the home network.
b. Suppose each host has two ongoing TCP connections, all to port 80 at
host 128.119.40.86. Provide the six corresponding entries in the NAT translation table.
