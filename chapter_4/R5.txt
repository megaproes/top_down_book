We said that a network layer’s service model “defines the characteristics of end-to-end transport of packets between sending and receiving hosts.” 

1. What is the service model of the Internet’s network layer? 

2. What guarantees are made by the Internet’s service model regarding the host-to-host delivery of datagrams?
------------------------------------

1. The Internet’s network layer provides a best-effort delivery service via the IP protocol, using source and destination IP addresses to move packets end-to-end.

2. This service makes no guarantees: datagrams may be lost, duplicated, or delivered out of order, and reliability is left to higher layers (e.g., TCP).
