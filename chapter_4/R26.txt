R26. Suppose you purchase a wireless router and connect it to your cable modem.

Also suppose that your ISP dynamically assigns your connected device (that is, your wireless router) one IP address. 

Also suppose that you have five PCs at home that use 802.11 to wirelessly connect to your wireless router. 

1. How are IP addresses assigned to the five PCs? 

2. Does the wireless router use NAT? Why or why not?
-----------------

1. They assigned dynamically to each host via DHCP protocol. 

2. Yes, because each of local hosts still share the same public IP address.
