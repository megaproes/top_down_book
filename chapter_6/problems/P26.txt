P26. Let’s consider the operation of a learning switch in the context of a network in which 6 nodes labeled A through F are star connected into an Ethernet switch. 

Suppose that 
(i)   B sends a frame to E, 
(ii)  E replies with a frame to B, 
(iii) A sends a frame to B, 
(iv)  B replies with a frame to A. 
The switch table is initially empty. Show the state of the switch table before and after each of these events. 
For each of these events, identify the link(s) on which the transmitted frame will be forwarded, and briefly justify your answers.
-------------------------
I’ll assume ports: A-1, B-2, C-3, D-4, E-5, F-6 (single VLAN).
(i) B -> E (ingress port 2)
	-- Learning: add B -> 2.
	-- Lookup dest E: unknown → flood to ports 1,3,4,5,6 (not 2).
	-- Table after (i): { B->2 }

(ii) E -> B (ingress port 5)
	-- Learning: add E → 5.
	-- Lookup dest B: known → unicast to port 2 only.
	-- Table after (ii): { B->2, E->5 }

(iii) A -> B (ingress port 1)

	-- Learning: add A -> 1.
	-- Lookup dest B: known -> unicast to port 2 only.
	-- Table after (iii): { A->1, B->2, E->5 }

(iv) B -> A (ingress port 2)
	-- Learning: source B seen again on port 2 -> refresh B->2 (no change).
	-- Lookup dest A: known -> unicast to port 1 only.
	-- Table after (iv): { A->1, B->2, E->5 } (unchanged)
