Consider Figure 6.33 in problem P14. Provide MAC addresses and IP addresses for the interfaces at Host A, both routers, and Host F. 

Suppose Host A sends a datagram to Host F. Give the source and destination MAC addresses in the frame encapsulating this IP datagram as 
the frame is transmitted 
(i) from A to the left router, 
(ii) from the left router to the right router,
(iii) from the right router to F. 

Also give the source and destination IP addresses in the IP datagram encapsulated within the frame at each of these points in time.
-----------------------------

Host A: 			 IP 192.168.1.50/24,  MAC AA:AA
Host F: 			 IP 192.168.3.156/24, MAC FF:FF
R1 (left, Subnet1):  IP 192.168.1.1, MAC R1-L
R1 (right, Subnet2): IP 192.168.2.1, MAC R1-R
R2 (left, Subnet2):  IP 192.168.2.2, MAC R2-L
R2 (right, Subnet3): IP 192.168.3.1, MAC R2-R


(i) A -> R1 (left, Subnet1)
Ethernet: src AA:AA, dst R1-L
IP: src 192.168.1.50, dst 192.168.3.156

(ii) R1 (right) -> R2 (left) over Subnet2
Ethernet: src R1-R, dst R2-L
IP: src 192.168.1.50, dst 192.168.3.156 (TTL âˆ’ 1)

(iii) R2 (right) -> F over Subnet3
Ethernet: src R2-R, dst FF:FF
IP: src 192.168.1.50, dst 192.168.3.156
