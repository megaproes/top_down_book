P22. Suppose now that the leftmost router in Figure 6.33 is replaced by a switch.

Hosts A, B, C, and D and the right router are all star-connected into this switch. 
Give the source and destination MAC addresses in the frame encapsulating this IP datagram as the frame is transmitted 
(i) from A to the switch,
(ii) from the switch to the right router, 
(iii) from the right router to F. 

Also give the source and destination IP addresses in the IP datagram encapsulated within the frame at each of these points in time.
