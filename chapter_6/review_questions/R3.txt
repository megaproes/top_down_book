R3. What are some of the possible services that a link-layer protocol can offer
to the network layer? Which of these link-layer services have corresponding services in IP? In TCP?
------------

1. Link-layer can provide framing, link access, reliable delivery, error detection/correction, and flow control.

2. IP provides only error detection (via header checksum in IPv4).

3. TCP provides reliable delivery, error detection, flow control, and congestion control at the end-to-end level.
