R10. Suppose nodes A, B, and C each attach to the same broadcast LAN (through their adapters). 

If A sends thousands of IP datagrams to B with each encapsulating frame addressed to the MAC address of B, will C’s adapter process these frames? 
If so, will C’s adapter pass the IP datagrams in these frames to the network layer C? 
How would your answers change if A sends frames with the MAC broadcast address?
-----------------

In a broadcast LAN, all adapters receive all frames. If A sends unicast frames addressed to B’s MAC, C’s adapter will see the frames but discard them at Layer 2 
since the destination MAC doesn’t match its own. The IP datagrams inside will not be passed up to C’s network layer.

If A instead sends frames to the broadcast MAC address, then all adapters, including C’s, will accept the frames and pass the encapsulated IP datagrams up to their network layers.
