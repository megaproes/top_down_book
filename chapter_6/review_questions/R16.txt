R16. Suppose that N switches supporting K VLAN groups are to be connected via a trunking protocol. How many ports are needed to connect the switches?
Justify your answer.
------------------
K VLANs don’t change the count because trunks tag all VLANs over the same link.
Each inter-switch link uses 2 switch ports (one at each end).
Choose your topology → count links → multiply by 2.

Case 1: Full mesh topology.
Every switch is directly connected to every other switch.
For N switches, the number of links is N(N - 1) / 2. Since each link uses 2 ports (one per switch),
total number of ports are 2 * (N(N - 1)/2) = N(N - 1). 

Case 2: Tree / star / topology
The minimum number of links to connect N switches is N−1 (like a spanning tree).
Each link uses 2 ports. 
So the total number of ports is: 2(N−1)
