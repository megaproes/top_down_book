R14. Consider Figure 6.15. How many subnetworks are there, in the addressing sense of Section 4.3?
--------------------
1. Router to Internet (the top-left link): that’s 1 subnet (router interface + ISP interface).

2. Router ↔ central switch (port 6): that’s another subnet. Router port + switch port(s).

3. Central switch ↔ Web server (port 5): 1 subnet.

4. Central switch ↔ Mail server (port 4): 1 subnet.

5. Central switch ↔ Electrical Eng. switch (port 1): that entire switch + hosts is 1 subnet.

6. Central switch ↔ Computer Science switch (port 2): that switch + hosts is 1 subnet.

7. Central switch ↔ Computer Engineering switch (port 3): that switch + hosts is 1 subnet.
