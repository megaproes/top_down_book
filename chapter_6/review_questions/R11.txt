R11. Why is an ARP query sent within a broadcast frame? Why is an ARP
response sent within a frame with a specific destination MAC address?
-------------

An ARP query is broadcast because the sender doesn’t know which MAC address corresponds to the target IP, so it must ask all hosts in the LAN. 

The ARP reply, however, is sent as a unicast to the requester’s MAC address, since only that host needs the mapping information.
